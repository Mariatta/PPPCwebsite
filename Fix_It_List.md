##Problems

1. When you click on the dropdown menu and click on the caret again to close it the tab is white with grey writing, even though you did not open any of the tabs subdomains
2. Break up index.html so that it functions the same but is shorter, easier to read, and all the other htmls are easy to find and understand

##Design needs
- Go through each page and format text so it is visually appealing
- Right now the website is not particularly visually appealing, if you are interested in designing the background, let us know panpacificpyladiesconf@gmail.com
