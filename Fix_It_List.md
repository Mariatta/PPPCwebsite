##Problems

1. When you click on the dropdown menu and click on the caret again to close it the tab is white with grey writing, even though you did not open any of the tabs subdomains
2. Break up index.html so that it functions the same but is shorter, easier to read, and all the other htmls are easy to find and understand
3. Edit the content, so far only one person has looked through the content so we need more eyes reading through everything


##New Functions/Material

1. News/blog tab 
2. Site map
3. Add a first time at PPPC page (which for this year is everyone) [http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/welcome-wagon/; http://doubleyouraudience.com/microconf-guide/; http://www.pydanny.com/beginners-guide-pycon-2014.html)
